#### A Culture of Growth: The Origins of the Modern Economy

Joel Mokyr

The Industrial Revolution reshaped the world, but why it began in Europe is still a puzzle. [Mokyr](https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691180960/a-culture-of-growth) traces its origins to a shift in how knowledge was used: scientists and skilled workers began testing new ideas on pumps, furnaces, and spinning machines, and publishing what worked so others could improve it. That collective habit, what Mokyr calls a culture of growth, became the engine of Europe’s economic success.
