Signals — AI-Powered Market Intelligence  Turn any company name or pitch deck into verified intelligence in seconds. Real-time web crawling, document parsing, and AI analysis — stored, searchable, and always updating.  Built at Hack the Stackathon @ YC HQ. Powered by Firecrawl, Reducto, MongoDB, OpenRouter, Supabase, and Resend.


## Core Infrastructure
- [x] ~~Create Express/FastAPI server with health check endpoint~~
- [x] ~~Set up Resend inbound webhook at `/webhook/email`~~
- [x] ~~Parse webhook payload to extract email body text~~
- [x] ~~Call Resend API to fetch full email body (webhook only sends metadata)~~

## Idea Parsing (MVP)
- [ ] Write Claude prompt: extract `{domain, problem, keywords[], competitors_mentioned[]}` from raw idea text
- [ ] Test: send email "AI tool for extracting renewal dates from SaaS contracts" → log parsed output
- [ ] ~~Store parsed idea in MongoDB `ideas` collection~~ *(stretch - use in-memory for demo)*

## Academic Research (stretch)
- [ ] ~~Register for Semantic Scholar API (free, no key needed for basic)~~
- [ ] ~~Write function `searchPapers(keywords)` → hits `/paper/search` endpoint~~
- [ ] ~~Extract: `{title, abstract, citationCount, year, url}` for top 5 results~~
- [ ] ~~Handle empty results gracefully (some ideas won't have papers)~~
- [ ] ~~Test: search "contract extraction NLP" → log 5 papers~~
- [ ] ~~Store papers in MongoDB under `idea.research.papers`~~

## HN Discussion Search (MVP)
- [x] ~~Write function `searchHN(keywords)` → hits Algolia HN API (`hn.algolia.io/api/v1/search`)~~
- [x] ~~Filter to stories + comments from last 2 years~~
- [x] ~~Extract: `{title, url, points, num_comments, created_at}` for top 5~~
- [ ] Test: search "SaaS contracts" on HN → log 5 threads
- [ ] ~~Store HN results in MongoDB under `idea.research.hn_discussions`~~ *(stretch)*

## Tech News (stretch)
- [ ] ~~Write function `scrapeTechmeme()` → Firecrawl scrape of techmeme.com homepage~~
- [ ] ~~Extract recent headlines mentioning keywords (simple string match)~~
- [ ] ~~Store Techmeme hits in MongoDB under `idea.research.tech_news`~~

## Competitor Research (MVP)
- [ ] Write function `searchCompetitors(domain, keywords)` → Firecrawl search API
- [ ] Query: `"{domain}" startup OR tool OR software`
- [ ] Extract: `{name, url, snippet}` for top 5 results
- [ ] ~~Write function `scrapeProductHunt(keywords)` → Firecrawl scrape of PH search~~ *(stretch)*
- [ ] ~~Extract: `{name, tagline, url, upvotes}` for top 5~~ *(stretch)*
- [ ] Dedupe competitors by domain
- [ ] Test: search "contract management" → log 5 competitors
- [ ] ~~Store competitors in MongoDB under `idea.research.competitors`~~ *(stretch)*

## Market Signals (stretch)
- [ ] ~~Write function `getMarketSignals(company_names)` → for each competitor:~~
  - [ ] ~~Firecrawl scrape company homepage → extract recent news/blog~~
  - [ ] ~~Firecrawl search `"{company}" funding OR raised OR hiring` → extract signals~~
- [ ] ~~Extract: `{company, signal_type, description, date, source_url}`~~
- [ ] ~~Store signals in MongoDB under `idea.research.market_signals`~~

## Embeddings (stretch)
- [ ] ~~Generate Voyage embedding for full research blob (for future similarity search)~~
- [ ] ~~Store embedding in MongoDB under `idea.embedding`~~

## Report Generation (MVP)
- [ ] Write Claude prompt: synthesize all research into structured report
- [ ] Sections: Executive Summary, ~~Academic Research,~~ Community Discussion, Competitive Landscape, ~~Market Signals,~~ Recommendation
- [ ] Require citations: every claim links to source
- [ ] Output as JSON with sections (not raw markdown)
- [ ] Test: pass full research object → log structured report
- [ ] ~~Store report in MongoDB under `idea.report`~~ *(stretch)*

## Email Output (MVP)
- [x] ~~Write function `formatReportEmail(report)` → converts JSON to HTML email~~
- [x] ~~Style: clean, scannable, mobile-friendly~~
- [x] ~~Include section headers, bullet points, clickable links~~
- [x] ~~Add verdict banner at top: "VALIDATED ✅" / "NEEDS MORE RESEARCH 🔍" / "CROWDED MARKET ⚠️"~~
- [x] ~~Send via Resend to original sender's email~~

## Demo Prep
- [ ] Test: trigger full flow → receive email in inbox
- [ ] ~~Measure end-to-end latency (target: <60s)~~ *(stretch)*
- [ ] ~~Pre-cache 3 example ideas with full research:~~ *(stretch)*
  - [ ] ~~"AI tool for extracting renewal dates from SaaS contracts"~~
  - [ ] ~~"Competitive intelligence dashboard for startups"~~
  - [ ] ~~"Voice cloning for podcast ads"~~
- [ ] Write demo script (90 seconds)
- [ ] Test Resend inbound with real email forward
- [ ] Add error handling: timeout fallbacks, empty results messaging
- [ ] Create 1-slide pitch: problem → solution → demo → stack
- [ ] Dry run demo 2x

**Minimum viable demo:**
- Email in → parsed idea
- HN results + competitors
- Claude-generated summary
- Email out
